|Bank Name|approach

|AAB Bank|embedded
|Olb Bank|embedded
|===

* The project was renamed from xs2a-gateway to xs2a-adapter to avoid misunderstanding with another adorsys project
* Switched from bank code (blz) to BIC for adapter resolution.
* Adapter configuration (ASPSP name, BIC, URL, adpterId) was decoupled from the code and now is sourced from a csv file.
* Added a possibility to provide a custom CSV file for adapter configuration through application environment variable `csv.aspsp.adapter.config.file.path`
